This is the main distribution site for ProFTPD. Rather than downloading
directly from this site, we STRONGLY recommend you use a mirror. This site
has a very limited number of simultaneous connections allowed, so a mirror
will probably be your best bet anyway. In addition, mirror sites are often
"closer" (network-wise) to you, and may provide faster and more reliable
transfers.

The list of mirror sites is at http://www.proftpd.org/download.html.
